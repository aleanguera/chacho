 <p style="font-size: 24pt;">Part I</p>
 <p>I see you have made it past the first hurdle - very good... very nice...</p>
 <p>There is a second clue I want you to have now. This time - you will need to go somewhere.</p>
 <br>
 <p> <i>I am three all in one,</i> </p>
 <p> <i>Yet I am incredibly light,</i> </p>
 <p> <i>Two have the power of flight,</i> </p>
 <p> <i>The other weighs over a tonne.</i> </p>
 <br>
 <p>You will have to look somewhere where you may find the 'ansuer' to the riddle.</p>
 <p>The answer to the riddle itself is not the password, just a hint for where you need to look.</p>
 <p>Good luck.</p>
 <br>
 <p>Once you have found the 'ansuer', type it below:</p>
 <p>Password:<input id="passwordBox" type="password"/></p>
