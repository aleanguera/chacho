 <p style="font-size: 30pt;">Part II</p>
 <p>I see you have made it past the first hurdle - very good... very nice...</p>
 <p>There is a second clue I want you to have now. This time - you will need to travel somewhere for it.</p>
 <p>It may be close or far away, but it is something necessary for your next clue.</p>
 <br>
 <p>The next clue is the following:</p>
 <br>
 <p> <i>I am three in one,</i> </p>
 <p> <i>Yet I am incredibly light,</i> </p>
 <p> <i>Two have the power of flight,</i> </p>
 <p> <i>And one weighs over a tonne.</i> </p>
 <br>
 <p>Once you have discovered the clue, return here.</p>
