 <p style="font-size: 30pt;">Part II</p>
 <p>I see you have made it past the first hurdle - very good... very nice...</p>
 <p>There is a second clue I want you to have now, this time - you will need to travel somewhere for it.</p>
 <p>It may be close or far away, but it is something necessary for your next clue.</p>
 <p>The next clue is the following:</p>
 <p> <i>Many dread the flight,</i> </p>
 <p> <i>Others from my skull get a fright,</i> </p>
 <p> <i>Not only am I useful despite,</i> </p>
 <p> <i>But for some I am a delight.</i> </p>
