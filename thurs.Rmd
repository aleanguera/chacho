# brrrum
I would feel extremely guilty if you were to spend money on driving back home
- *Petrol* is expensive
- Wearing the tyres would also be bad
- Rallying is tough on the handbrake
- You probably don't want to change another suspension

# Distance to Work
Distances are also not short
- A study by [Redacted] and [Redacted] (2021) demonstrated that long distances are long, and long distances are longer than non-long distances
- See next slide for study's findings
- Might be at least 2 minutes faster than other direction

# Distance to Work (cont.)
```{r}
library(leaflet)
Longitude <- c(-1.6288345, -1.9544758, -1.5916416)
Latitude <- c(+54.9714967, +55.1178794, +54.9724386)
table <- data.frame(Longitude, Latitude)
fullmap <- leaflet(data = table[1:3,]) %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude)
fullmap

# Healthcare
- You get to sleep in slightly more - which has immune system benefits <a href="http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/ram/v65n2/2448-9190-ram-65-02-160.pdf">(Rosillo & Robledo, 2018)</a> and is also fucking nice to sleep in
- Massages are shown to improve cold and flu symptoms <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/moyer.pdf">(Moyer et al., 2004)</a>
- Magpies are an easy target from my window

# Whatever, forever
- No good reason to leave bed tomorrow
- Watch 'Planet Earth'
- Brainstorm tattoos
- Order food
- Sleep in
